You awake!!!! It's nighttime and you're laying on a patch of grass. You look up and see that you are in someones fronts lawn. You think to yourself, where am I? You look towards the house. The front door reads 842./
Type investigate to look around the yard or type walk to walk up to the house./
You stand. The yard is lush and well kept. A white picket fence surrounds the yard. You walk over to the mailbox and open it. Inside is a single folded sheet of paper. You unfold the paper. It reads YOUARESPECIAL in all caps and no spaces. You stuff the letter in your pocket./
You do not want to be here. Type run to run away./
You sprint down the street into the darkness/ 
What's going on? I thought I was just running?/
You walk up to the door. It is locked. There is a keypad on the door knob that requires a password./ 
You stand. You check your pocket. You pull out a handful of folded slips of paper. Each one reading YOUARESPECIAL. You feel trapped. Have I been going in circles? You turn to the house. It seems it is your only option./
Type look to look around the yard/
Enter password:/ 
Type walk to walk towards the house/
You are inside the house. The door closes behind you. Did you do that? You look around and see that the whole house is well furnished and clean. If you were to walk in here under normal circumstances you might think it a pleasant place to live. But these are not normal circumstances./
You take out your flashlight and am grateful that it is fully charged./
You take out your lighter, but it is out of lighter fluid. Stupid piece of plastic./
You begin to make your way through the house. The flashlight lighting your path. You enter the living room. It is very quiet. Your eye catches a cup of coffee siting on the coffee table. A single post it note is stuck to the side. You grab the post it note./
Have I been here before?/
Type look to look around the room/
Your heart begins to race. You put down the post it note and continue to examine the room. Suddenly you stop when you notice some scrapes on the walls. They seem to go behind a book shelf, as if someone has been moving the bookshelf. You probably wouldn't have found the scrapes without a flashlight./
Type walk to approach the bookshelf/
I think you can move it/
Type push to move the bookshelf/
Just a little more./ 
Type push again/
The bookshelf moves revealing a hidden passage behind it. You shine your flashlight down into the darkness revealing a staircase leading down. A post it note is stuck to the side of wall./
Type descend to descend the stairs./
You begin to walk down the staircase. Even with the flashlight, the end of the staircase is not in sight./
Down and down you travel. After an hour of walking you begin to wonder if there will ever be an end./
Your flashlight slowly becomes dimmer and dimmer, until it completely goes out./
Darkness.../
Silence.../
You can feel the folded sheet of paper in your pocket. Am I special? How am I special? Why am I here?/
Slowly you start noticing dim lights all around you. Multicolor blobs of floating light. The lights begin to consume your senses. All you can see or hear or experience is the floating lights. You try to scream, but you make no sound./
You awake in your bed covered in sweat. You look around your room. Everything seems normal. Feeling relieved you role back onto your side. Just before you close your eyes you notice a post it note stuck to your bedside lamp./
You're now regretting your decision to grab the rope. Not sure how it is going to help you./
You begin to inch your way into the dark house. Slowly your eyes adjust to the darkness. Up ahead you see a staircase. Slowly you make your way to the handrail and stand at the base of the stairs./
You climb up the stairs. At the top you now stand in a long hallway. Many doors jut off to the side, but one ominous door sits at the end of the hall./
You look down at the useless lighter in your hand. You are thinking of chucking it down the hall, just to see what would happen./
Type chuck to throw the lighter, or type keep to hold on to it./
You throw the lighter. It soars through the air and then hits the floor and skids towards the ominous door. The sound of the lighter landing is defining when compared to the silence of the house. You hold your breath for a moment until suddenly you hear another sound.../
The ominous door begins to creak open./
You are paralyzed with fear./
Suddenly the door swings completely open and a blinding white light fills the hallway./
Quickly you sprint down the stairs./
You decide not to throw the lighter. You put it back in your pocket and begin to walk down the hallway./
You now are standing at the ominous door. Hand hovering over the door handle./ 
Type open to open the door./
You grip the door knob and begin to turn. Suddenly the door swings open revealing a blinding white light. You fall backwards onto the ground./ 
Type get up to stand./
You scramble to your feet and sprint towards the stairs./
You reach the bottom of the stairs. Your vision is slowly returning after being blinded by the light. When you vision comes back you realize that you are no longer in the house. You don't know where you are. You're in a white room with no windows, no doors, no staircase and no visible source of light, yet you can see clearly now. Clearly you can see what is written on the walls./
There is no escape./
Why did I grab this rope?!?/
"HELLOOOOOOOOO"!!!! 
You shout./
